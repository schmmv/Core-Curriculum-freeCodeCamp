        <code>Rear-facing only seats</code>
        <p>The AAP recommends that all infants ride rear facing starting with their first ride home from the hospital. All infants and young children should ride in a rear-facing seat as long as possible until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car safety seat manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Rear seats are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used for infants up to 22 to 35 pounds and 26 to 35 inches, depending on the model.</li>
          <li>Small and have carrying handles.</li>
          <li>Usually come with a base that can be left in the car. The seat clicks into and out of the base so you don't have to install the seat each time you use it. Parents can buy more than one base for additional vehicles.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <code>Convertible seats</code>
        <code>All-in-one seats</code>
        <p>Any child who has outgrown the rear-facing weight or height limit for her convertible seat should use a forward-facing seat with a harness for as long as possible, up to the highest weight or height allowed by her car safety seat manufacturer.
        </p>

        <code>Belt-positioning booster seats</code>
        <p>Booster seats are for older children who have outgrown their forward-facing seats. All children whose weight or height exceeds the forward-facing limit for their car safety seat should use a belt-positioning booster seat until the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they have reached 4 feet 9 inches in height and are 8 to 12 years of age.</p>
        <p>Most children will not fit in most vehicle seat belts without a booster until 10 to 12 years of age. All children younger than 13 years should ride in the back seat. Instructions that come with your car safety seat will tell you the height and weight limits for the seat.</p>
        <p>As a general guideline, a child has outgrown a forward-facing seat when any of the following situations is true: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They reach the top weight or height allowed for their seat with a harness. (These limits are listed on the seat and in the instruction manual.)</li>
          <li>Their shoulders are above the top harness slots.
          </li>
          <li>The tops of their ears have reached the top of the seat.</li>
        </ul>
